My Ameriacan teacher’s name is Keith, He is tall and strong. He has lived in Chengdu for a year. This year, he becomes a freshman in Sichuan University. He is leaning advanced Chinese by now. He knows a lot of vocabulary but he can’t make sentences flently. He want to be ahead of others and be perfect. So we help each other to be successful. I help him do his homework and learn everyday expression. Also I corrct his pronounciation. He helps me in pronounciation and formal expresion in English in return. Sometimes, it’s hard to explain the meaning of Chinese words which is new for him. I like to take an example, but he wants to know the definition. We will end our conversation with great laughter.
I make a progress in my listening and speaking with his help.
