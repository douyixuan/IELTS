Some people think living in big cities is bad for people’s health. To what extent do you agree or disagree?



I slightly disagree with the view that life in big city contributes to harmful effects on health of people.


There are certain reasons of the concern.
Pollution is the first factor.
Vulnerable people have more risks to get lung diseases because of air pollution.
And noise pollution is responsible for bad quality of sleep and too much headaches of people.
In addition, fast pace of city life poses a threat to people health.
People living in big city undertake huge pressure every day.
Not only people have to eat more junk food to spare time for their work,
but also they have to stay up late to finish extra work.


While, big city does bring plenty of benefits to our health.
For most people, it is convenient to get treatment in equipped hospitals.
We can enjoy more advanced facility provided by major metropolitan.
There are also more famous doctors in advanced hospital of big city.
Another reason is that life in big city is comfortable and livable.
If we live an comfortable life, we will be more happy, which is good for your health.
Major city also offer safe surroundings, which is usually concerned about by people.

From my perspective, living in a major metropolitan bring us more benefits on people’s health.
