Some people think living in big cities is bad for people’s health. To what extent do you agree or disagree?



Undoutedly, we are getting used to living in large city.
Modern urban life takes many benefits to us in plenty of aspects.
But some people are concerned about the harmful impact of life in big city.


There are certain reasons why people think that city life has an bad effect on them.
Pollution is the first factor.
For axample,
Air pollution make it easier for vulnerable people to get lung diseases.
And noise pollution is also responsible for bad quality of sleep and too much headaches of people.
In addition, fast pace of city life poses a threat to people health.
People living in big coties suffer a burden of stress every day.
Not only people have to eat more junk food to spare time for their work,
but also they have to stay up late to realease their pressure from work.


While, big city does bring amounts of advantages to our life.
On the one hand, it is convenient to enjoy all kinds of facilities provided by big city.
If we want to take leisure, we can go to a theater or a gallery.
If we want to educate ourselves, there are different options, such as museum and technology exhibition.
On the other hand, working in big city is a such brilliant choice because it is effective.
There is great management structure in company, making people motivated and effective.
Modern human resource management activities based on different personality is also a powerful method that promote employees’ production ratio.

From my perspective, living in a big city has both advantages and disadvantages.
